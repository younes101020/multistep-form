## Use cases

### How to add it into my project ?

You have to export 3 files available in this repository into your project, namely: `./src/app/_contexts/StepProvider.tsx`, `./src/app/_components/StepsHeader.tsx`, and `./src/app/_hooks/useStep.tsx.`

## How to use it ?

Wrap your steps in StepProvider. The order of the steps is determined by their placement within the StepProvider. Example:

```tsx
<StepProvider>
  <Login />
  <Synchronize />
  <CreateTeam />
</StepProvider>
```

Here, Login will be considered as the first step, and CreateTeam will be the last one.

You also have to add some description about your step inside `STEP_METADATA` object you will find it inside `./src/app/_components/StepsHeader.tsx`
